checkbox_depend.js

A simple jQuery plugin for handling checkbox dependence. 

This plugin is given a set of rules (prerequisites and conflicts) that it enforces for the checkboxes within it's scope.

Prerequisite checkboxes are forcibly checked when a change event occurs that checks the box. 
Conflict checkboxes are disabled when a change even occurs that checks the box.

Prerequisite and conflict rules are expected to be symmetric. This is to say that if A has prerequisite (or conflict) B, then B must also have a prerequisite (or conflict) A.

Rules can be provided as a function parameter or set directly on the data-prereqs and data-conflicts attributes of the inputs.

Usage:

  Apply the plugin to a container div that is the parent of the relevant checkbox inputs.

  >> $('.root').checkboxDepend(rules);

  See test.html as sample usage.
